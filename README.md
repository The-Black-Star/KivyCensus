Updated version of PyEcoCensus. This was a student project that was made to work with the specific drone setups used by the Geology lab running the project.

##Use
Takes pictures with exif and xmp data taken by drones flying over the rainforests in hawaii, splits up the images, runs them through a machine learned model which detects the existence of miconia plants in the images, and returns the gps coordinates of those plants into a text file.
